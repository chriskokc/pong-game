# pong-game
# A classic and popular computer game which is like playing an exciting table tennis competition

A pong-game involves two players hitting a ball back and forth until one of them miss it. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) has been adopted to model real-life objects such as a ball, two paddles, and also a scoreboard. The classes are created by inheriting Turtle class from turtle module. The speed of ball is designed to increase during the game to make it more challenging, and the winning score is set to 15 points. The two players (Left player and Right player) use w and s keys, and up and down arrow keys to control the paddles.
